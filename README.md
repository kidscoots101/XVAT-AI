# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## To-do (cross off when done)

- ~Determine the type of file uploaded (e.g. PDF/JPEG) and reject the wrong file types (e.g. DMG/WAV).~
- Set up cloud storage of files.
- Link AI functionality through the back-end.
- Add side bar (pain).
- Preview of files (?).
- Set up account system.
